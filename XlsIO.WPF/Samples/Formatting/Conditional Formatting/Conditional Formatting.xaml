Microsoft Office Excel 2007 provides enhanced conditional formatting support. Conditional formatting allows you to apply formatting to one or more cells based on the value of the cell or the value of a formula.

XlsIO also supports applying more than three conditional formats to the same cell in XLSX, similar to Excel 2007. Note that it is not possible to apply more than three conditional formats in earlier versions of Excel.
