The cell format in a spreadsheet dictates how data will be displayed, whether the cell will have borders, and other information. All of the cell formatting commands can be reached through a context menu by right clicking on a cell and selecting the "Format Cells" menu entry. You can also apply this formatting based on conditions called "Conditional Formatting." These can be accessed through the format menu in Excel.
