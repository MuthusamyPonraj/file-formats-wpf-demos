<Paragraph>This sample focuses on the encryption and decryption of an Excel 2007 workbook using Essential XlsIO.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>Encryption is a method of protecting workbook data.  It is based on a password that converts the data into a form that cannot be understood.It also restricts anonymous users from accessing a document. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form so that data can be read from the workbook.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>A password for encrypting a workbook can be set in Microsoft Excel 2007 through the <Bold>Office Menu->Prepare->Encrypt Document</Bold> command.</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
<Bold>Note:</Bold>
Password protection of a workbook file is different from the workbook structure and window protection you can set in the <Bold>Review->Protect Workbook </Bold>
