Excel provides various page-setup options to control the way your spreadsheet fits onto paper; this is done using the "Page Setup" dialog. This allows you to select the size and orientation of the paper, the width of the margins, the headers and footers for each page, and the order of printing cells for sheets that will take several pieces of paper.
